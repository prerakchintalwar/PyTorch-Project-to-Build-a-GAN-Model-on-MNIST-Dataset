# PyTorch-Project-to-Build-a-GAN-Model-on-MNIST-Dataset
Have you ever wondered how photo editing applications are able to convert night images to day images? One of the powerful tools to achieve this is Generative Adversarial Networks also known as GAN. 

**Overview**


Have you ever wondered how photo editing applications are able to convert night images to day images? Also, you must have come across some photos of people who do not exist in the world. One of the powerful tools to achieve this is Generative Adversarial Networks also known as GAN. The GANs are mainly used in image-to-image translation and to generate photorealistic images which even a human fails to identify as fake or true.

In this project, we start by introducing Generative Adversarial Networks. The PyTorch framework is used to build the GAN model on the MNIST dataset. Finally, we learn how to use the Generator model for generating new images of digits.


**Aim**
1. To understand the theory behind Generative Adversarial Network
