Have you ever wondered how photo editing applications are able to convert night images to day images? One of the powerful tools to achieve this is Generative Adversarial Networks also known as GAN. 

**Overview**


Have you ever wondered how photo editing applications are able to convert night images to day images? Also, you must have come across some photos of people who do not exist in the world. One of the powerful tools to achieve this is Generative Adversarial Networks also known as GAN. The GANs are mainly used in image-to-image translation and to generate photorealistic images which even a human fails to identify as fake or true.

In this project, we start by introducing Generative Adversarial Networks. The PyTorch framework is used to build the GAN model on the MNIST dataset. Finally, we learn how to use the Generator model for generating new images of digits.

1. To understand the theory behind Generative Adversarial Network
2. To build Generative Adversarial Networks in PyTorch


**Tech Stack**
* Language: Python
* Libraries: torch, torchvision,numpy, matplotlib



**Project Takeaways**

1. What is Generative Adversarial Network?

* A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a class of machine learning models designed to generate new data that resembles a given dataset. GANs consist of two main components: a generator and a discriminator. These components are trained simultaneously through a competitive process, where the generator aims to produce increasingly realistic data, while the discriminator's goal is to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generator.

2. Use of Generative Adversarial Network

* GANs find applications in various domains, including image synthesis, style transfer, data augmentation, super-resolution, text-to-image synthesis, and more. They are known for their ability to generate high-quality data that can be used for creative purposes, data augmentation, and even generating entirely new data points.

3. What is Generator?

* The generator in a GAN is a neural network that takes random noise as input and generates data that aims to resemble the real data. In an image GAN, for example, the generator generates images. The generator is tasked with creating data that is indistinguishable from real data by the discriminator.

4. What is Discriminator?

* The discriminator, also a neural network, evaluates the input data and determines whether it is real (from the original dataset) or fake (generated by the generator). It essentially acts as a binary classifier. The discriminator is trained to improve its ability to correctly classify real and fake data.

5. Understanding architecture of Generative Adversarial Network

* A GAN typically consists of a generator and a discriminator network. The generator network produces fake data, while the discriminator network evaluates the authenticity of the data. These networks are trained alternately, with the generator aiming to produce better fake data over time, and the discriminator becoming more skilled at distinguishing real from fake data.

6. The loss function of Generator

* The loss function of the generator aims to minimize the ability of the discriminator to differentiate between real and fake data. One common loss function used for the generator is the binary cross-entropy loss. The generator wants the discriminator to output high probabilities for the generated data being real.

7. The Loss function of Discriminator

* The discriminator's loss function is also typically a binary cross-entropy loss. It aims to correctly classify real data as real (with high probability) and fake data as fake (with high probability).

8. How to download and transform data in PyTorch?

* The input image size for each layer in a GAN's generator and discriminator depends on the architecture you choose, including factors like the type of layers (convolutional, fully connected), the stride, padding, and pooling. Generally, the input size decreases as you move deeper into the network due to the application of convolutions and pooling layers.

9. How to calculate the input image size for each layer?

* To build a GAN from scratch in PyTorch, you would define the generator and discriminator networks as separate classes, define loss functions (usually binary cross-entropy), set up optimizers for each network, and alternate between training the generator and discriminator in a loop. The training process involves feeding real and generated data to the discriminator and updating the networks' parameters accordingly.

11. How to train the model on Colab with GPU?

* To train a model on Google Colab with a GPU, you need to upload your code and dataset to Colab, then make sure you're using GPU-accelerated runtime. You can change the runtime type from the "Runtime" menu at the top of the Colab interface. Choose "Change runtime type" and select GPU as the hardware accelerator.

13.Applications of GAN

* GANs have a wide range of applications, including image generation, style transfer, data augmentation, image-to-image translation, super-resolution, text-to-image synthesis, image inpainting, and more.

14. How to generate a fake image by using the Generator?

* To generate a fake image using the trained generator, you input random noise to the generator network. The generator will then process this noise and produce an image that should resemble the real data distribution it was trained on. This generated image can be transformed back into a usable format (e.g., an image file) for visualization and analysis.
